# first_django_project-
This is my first project using the Django Framework for backend development in python

I am adept at using the Flask framework as it is lightweight and highly customizable, but decided to learn the leading python framework for backend web development 

This project was inspired by Corey Schafer's Django tutorial on youtube, and I made some changes to the original app he made in the tutorial like 
1. Displaying the user's posts on their profile page when clicked
2. Making A basic overview of the each user's profile accessible to anyone 

My inspiration for making these customizations was gotten from facebook and twitter.
